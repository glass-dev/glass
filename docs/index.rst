**********************************************
**GLASS**: Generator for Large Scale Structure
**********************************************

========
Synopsis
========

GLASS, the generator for large scale structure, is a numerical code for
performing the kind of simulation that is useful in the field of cosmology.  As
the name suggests, the code was originally designed to simulate cosmic matter,
weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy positions.  Since then, GLASS has become
a platform for a wide range of cosmological and astrophysical simulations,
thanks to its ultra-flexible design and open architecture.
