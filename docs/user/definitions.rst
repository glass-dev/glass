   ellipticity
      If :math:`q = b/a` is the axis ratio of an elliptical isophote with
      semi-major axis :math:`a` and semi-minor axis :math:`b`, and :math:`\phi`
      is the orientation of the elliptical isophote, the complex-valued
      ellipticity is

      .. math::

         \epsilon = \frac{1 - q}{1 + q} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \, 2\phi} \;.

   visibility map
      A visibility map describes the *a priori* probability of observing an
      object inside a given pixel, with pixel values between 0 and 1.
