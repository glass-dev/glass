Examples
========

These examples show how GLASS can be used in practice.  They are often a good
starting point for more complicated and realistic simulations.

The examples currently require `CAMB`__ to produce angular matter power spectra
and for the cosmological background.  Make sure you have CAMB installed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -c 'import camb'  # should not give an error

If you want to compute the angular matter power spectra in the examples, you
need the ``glass.ext.camb`` package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install glass.ext.camb
