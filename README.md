the original GLASS paper](CITATION.md) in your publications.


Getting in touch
----------------

The best way to get help about the code is currently to get in touch.

If you would like to start a discussion with the wider GLASS community about
e.g. a design decision or API change, you can use our [Discussions] page.

If you are running into problems, suspect a bug, or have a quick question, you
can chat on our [Gitter channel].

If you are looking for a longer, asynchronous discussion, e.g. about
implementing new models or creating extensions, you can join our [Slack
workspace].
